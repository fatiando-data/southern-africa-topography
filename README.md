## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Crop it to a region that covers only the Southern Africa.
* Rename the coordinates to `longitude` and `latitude`.
* Rename the `xarray.DataArray` to `topography`.
* Improved metadata of the dataset following CF-conventions.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
